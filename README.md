### Hi there 👋

#### I'm _PHP Back-end_ developer

- 💻👨🏻‍🎓 I'm currently *computer science student*.
  
- 🌱 I’m learning more back-end. I think that no matter how much I learn, it is **not enough** to say that I have reached a normal level.
  
- ‍🔥 I do my projects with **Laravel** & **tailwind css**.
  
- 🧾 my resume can be seen on [my github site](https://am-mokhtari.github.io):
```
