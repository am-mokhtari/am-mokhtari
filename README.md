### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently computer science student.
  
- 🌱 I’m learning more back-end. I think that no matter how much I learn, it is not enough to say that I have reached a normal level.
  
- ❤️‍🔥 I do my projects with Laravel & tailwind css.
  
- 🧾 my resume can be seen on [my github site](https://am-mokhtari.github.io):
```
